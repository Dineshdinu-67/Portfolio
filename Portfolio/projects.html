        Your project involves creating a weather app using HTML and CSS. The app will allow users to check the weather
        conditions in different locations. You will be using HTML to create the structure of the app, and CSS to style
        it and make it visually appealing. The app will display weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and
        precipitation. Users will be able to input their location and the app will use an API to retrieve the relevant
        weather data. Your goal is to create a user-friendly and visually attractive weather app that provides accurate
        and up-to-date information to its users.
